  Canoa is a small fishing village in Ecuador with around 17km of beautiful beach, making it the longest 
  beach in Ecuador! We are located around 2km south of the town, on a quiet section of beach, but still 
  close enough to walk into town in around 20 minutes. Canoa is famous for having the most amazing sunsets!
